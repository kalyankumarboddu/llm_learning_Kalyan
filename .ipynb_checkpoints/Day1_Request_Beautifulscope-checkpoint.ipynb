(PTI Photo/Ravi Choudhary)follow usfollow usCongress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused the Election Commission of failing to uphold the \"one person, one vote\" principle, alleging widespread and systematic irregularities in electoral rolls.\"All over the country, this is happening. The EC knows it, and we know it too,\" the Leader of Opposition told reporters in Parliament. \"Earlier, there was no evidence. Now there is. We protect the Constitution, and we will continue to do so. We will not stop,\" he added. Referring to reports of a 124-year-old woman, Minta Devi, listed as a first-time voter in Bihar, Gandhi said, \"There are unlimited cases like that. Abhi picture baki hai.\"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also claimed multiple voter entries with fake names and addresses.Earlier in the day, MPs from the opposition INDIA bloc staged a protest in Parliament against the voter roll revision in Bihar. Many wore white T-shirts featuring Minta Devi’s photo with \"124 Not Out\" printed on the back.The protest, led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, TMC’s Derek O’Brien, DMK’s TR Baalu, NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule, and other MPs from DMK and Left parties, demanded the rollback of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise.Congress MP Manickam Tagore accused the poll panel of acting like a \"department of the BJP\" under Chief Election Commissioner Rajeev Kumar and Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar. \"The voters list is full of fraud,\" he said.Parliament has been deadlocked for weeks over the SIR issue, with proceedings repeatedly adjourned since the Monsoon Session began July 21. On Monday, opposition leaders marched from Parliament to the EC office but were stopped midway by police and briefly detained.Latest News PreviousspiritualKeeping It On Periphery : Sadhguru’s Friendly Advice To Youth On Pornography And Masturbationentertainment newsArjun Bijlani Reacts To Supreme Court’s Verdict On Stray Dogs In Delhi-NCR: My Heart Breaks... – EXCLUSIVEindiaMajor Atmanirbhar Push: India Approves Four Semiconductor Plants Worth Rs 4,594 Crore - To Be Set Up In Three StatessportsPSG Dressing Room in Huge Turmoil Over Ballon d\\'Or Awardentertainment newsJohn Abraham Says He Will NEVER Make Movies Like Chhaava, The Kashmir Files: When Films Are Made With Intent To Sway...entertainment newsSara Ali Khan Turns 30: Metro In Dino Actress Shares Glimpse Of Her \\'Pink\\' Birthday, Thanks Fans For Heartwarming WishesindiaBihar SIR Hearing: Two \\'Dead\\' Persons Surface in Supreme Court - And This Happened...entertainment newsKangana Ranaut Calls Jaya Bachchan \\'Most Spoilt Woman\\' After Veteran Actress Pushes Fan NextArpita Ghosh authorArpita Ghosh (She/Her) is an Assistant Editor at Times Now Digital, with over eight years of experience in digital journalism.
